> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the in development branch of Prowl. It contains a Unity like API with GameObjects and Scenes. I forked it right before the lead developer (Wulferis) was about to do a quick rewrite of the engine to use BGFX. It will probably be better once that is done (maybe that will be done within a few days haha) but I wanted my own fork of Prowl that was confirmed working on Mac and Windows. Be sure to check out the original Prowl repository for the latest changes.

### About The Project

Prowl is an open-source, **[MIT-licensed](#span-aligncenter-license-span)** game engine developed in **pure C# in latest .NET**. Be sure to check out the [original repository](https://github.com/ProwlEngine/Prowl)!

It aims to provide a seamless transition for developers familiar with _Unity_ by maintaining a similar API while also following KISS and staying as small and customizable as possible. Ideally, _Unity_ projects can port over with as little resistance as possible.

Please keep in mind that this is a fork of Prowl that was incredibly new and unstable and the main repository of Prowl should be used instead.

### Editor
The standalone branch of Prowl that this fork was based on does not have an editor, and instead is a fully code first engine. Eventually the editor will be added back again. But yeah, if you are reading this please check out the Prowl repository for the latest updates.
